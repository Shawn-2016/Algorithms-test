## Strings rearrangement

Given an array of equal-length strings, check if it is possible to rearrange the strings in such a way that after the rearrangement the strings at consecutive positions would differ by exactly one character.

For `inputArray = ["aba", "bbb", "bab"]`, the output should be `stringsRearrangement(inputArray) = false`

For `inputArray = ["ab", "bb", "aa"]`, the output should be `stringsRearrangement(inputArray) = true`. Strings can be rearranged in the following way: `"aa", "ab", "bb"`.
