## Reverse parentheses
You have a string `s` that consists of English letters, punctuation marks, whitespace characters, and brackets. It is guaranteed that the parentheses in `s` form a regular bracket sequence (A bracket sequence is called regular if it is possible to insert some numbers and signs into the sequence in such a way that the new sequence will represent a correct arithmetic expression).

Your task is to reverse the strings contained in each pair of matching parentheses, starting from the innermost pair. The results string should not contain any parentheses.

**Constraints**:
`5 ≤ s.length ≤ 55`
